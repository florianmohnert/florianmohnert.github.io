### About me
Currently, I am a student in the [Artificial Intelligence Master's](http://gss.uva.nl/content/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html/) program at the University of Amsterdam. Previously, I graduated with a BSc. in Psychology from the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en) and also with minor in mathematics and computer science that I primarily completed during my exchange semester at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I wrote my Originally, I am from Hamburg in Germany.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and cognitive science. For example, I am inspired by computational models of human learning and decision making not just to model the human mind but also to create more powerful AI systems. Additionally, I am facinated by statistical methods to understand and analyze language. 

<!-- END of JUNE, add: Currently I am interning at the Max Plank institute for intelligent systems in the Rationality Enhancement group. and in projects: - **Evaluating the rational metareasoning model of strategy selection against process-tracing data on risky choice** (Rationality Enhancement group, MPI TÃ¼bingen) -->


### Projects
- **Analyzing how LSTM language models accomplish tracking long term syntactic dependencies** (_Institute for Logic, Language and computation, UvA_ )
- **Graphical models for exploratory analyses in social psychology** (_Department of Statistics, RUG_)
