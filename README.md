## Hi there!

I am a Master's student in [Artificial Intelligence](http://gss.uva.nl/content/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html/) at the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/en/home). During this summer I am interning at the [Max Plank Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de/) in the [Rationality Enhancement Group](https://sites.google.com/site/falklieder/) where I am supervised by Dr. Falk Lieder. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and cognitive science. I am inspired by computational models of human learning and decision making not just to understand the human mind but also to create more powerful AI systems. For example, my current project aims at modelling human decision making in risky choice scenarios with metacognitive reinforement learning.

During the first year of my Master in Amsterdam I also got really interested in applying deep learning techniques in Natural Language Processing. In particular, I worked on a joint project in which we were tackling the question how language models based on Recurrent Neural Networks accomplish tracking long term syntactic dependencies.

I started my academic journey with a BSc. in Psychology from the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en) where I put my focus on cognitve psychology and statistical methods. In my final year I obtained a Minor in mathematics and computer science that I primarily completed during my exchange semester at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I wrote my bachelor thesis on how probabilisitc graphical models can be used in social psychology to explore datasets that aim at testing mutliple psychological theories. Originally, I am from Hamburg in Germany.
