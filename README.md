## Hi there!

### About me
I am a Master's student in [Artificial Intelligence](http://gss.uva.nl/content/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html/) at the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/en/home). During this summer I am interning at the [Max Plank Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de/) in the [Rationality Enhancement Group](https://sites.google.com/site/falklieder/) where I am supervised by Dr. Falk Lieder. 

I started my academic journey with a BSc. in Psychology from the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/?lang=en) where I put my focus on cognitve psychology and statistical methods. In my final year I obtained a Minor in mathematics and computer science that I primarily completed during my exchange semester at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I wrote my bachelor thesis on how probabalisitc graphical models can be used in social psychology to explore datasets that aim at testing mutliple psychological theories. Originally, I am from Hamburg in Germany.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and cognitive science. For example, I am inspired by computational models of human learning and decision making not just to model the human mind but also to create more powerful AI systems. Additionally, I am facinated by statistical methods to understand and analyze language.
