## Hi there!

I am a Master's student in [Artificial Intelligence](http://gss.uva.nl/content/masters/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence.html/) at the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/en/home). At present, I am interning at the [Max Plank Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de/) in the [Rationality Enhancement Group](https://sites.google.com/site/falklieder/) where I am supervised by Dr. Falk Lieder. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and computational cognitive science. Inspired by the computational efficiency of the human mind I am building computational models of human planning, decision making and language not just to understand the human mind but also to create more powerful AI systems. 

For example my current project on goal setting for bounded agents, aims at understanding the mechanisms behind human goal setting and therewith building AI systems with improved hierarchical planning capabilities. In another project I'm modelling human decision making in risky choice scenarios with resource rational adaptive toolbox models.

During the first year of my Master in Amsterdam I developed a keen interest in Natural Language Processing. In particular, I worked on a project tackling the question of how language models based on Recurrent Neural Networks accomplish tracking long term hierarchical dependencies. 

I am also interested in making future AI systems more interactive, such that AI systems are not just passively learning from datasets but learn to understand human intends and goals by asking the right questions and receiving feedback from humans. Ultimately, such AI systems should be used to enhance human communication for example by detecting flaws in human reasoning.
